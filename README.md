# comp163-assignment-4
# the "game was about picking how hard a class selection would be and what that would be to the student i wanted each choice to affect the student differently based on their starting stats
## if can be seen everywhere i tried to use logical operators were used in parts 3 and four while membership and identity operators were only used in 4
## running it would be simple just choose or put in your information at the start choose a difficulty level and then choose your prefered classes and i would spit out what youll have and be able to do
## the different endings are differnet student types and how they should work and study based on course load
## i used ai to help me under where and how to use the membership operator
